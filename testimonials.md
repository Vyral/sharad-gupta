<p><strong><em>"“Me and my wife are very thankful to Sharad on helping us find our very first home. He and his team are great people to work with and are very helpful. We had an initial discussion to talk about our requirements, etc. and he worked with us to put together a plan that suited us. Sharad is very knowledgeable about the real estate market and he was helpful in answering all our queries and guided us in each and every step throughout the complete buying process. He is responsive and very professional. Cannot recommend him enough.”</em></strong></p><p>- Devesh Kumar</p><p><br/>


<br/><strong><em>“Me and my partner are both software engineers and numbers guys. We spoke with a couple of other agents, who were not able to match our frequency. After interviewing 3-4 agents, we called Gupta after reading his online reviews. His understanding of the market and the way he priced our property just knocked us off. From there it was a smooth sail. Got 8.32% above our asking.“</em></strong><p>- Jasmine Ponce</p><p><br/>

<br/><strong><em>“...the team @ Sharad Gupta was terrific. They communicated very effectively and efficiently and are very knowledgeable. My favorite part of working with them was their honest and direct feedback. I feel that they have the best interest of their clients at heart. I will be using them again in the near future”</em></strong><p>- David Bowie</p><p><br/>

<br/><strong><em>“We were short on cash and wanted to sell fast. Sharad’s team got us a small-term loan for fixes. He also recommended us contractors and worked on the entire timeline. We almost made 5-7% more on our sale after he fixed, staged and marketed our home. His home-sale guarantees attracted lots of buyers. His marketing system is unique.”</em></strong><p>- Paul Hardy</p><p><br/>

<br/><strong><em>“We were ready to waste over 30K in our house kitchen and bathroom remodel before selling. Gupta came in and gave us great tips on where to spend the money for the maximum return. Our home sold in less than 2 weeks for almost 3.3% above our expectations.“</em></strong><p>- Kimberly Rose Octubre</p><p><br/>

<br/><strong><em>“After our home was staged, we realized what a difference it makes, Sharad’s team had been very vocal and careful about the need for staging. And it ultimately paid off. We got multiple offers within a few days and way above our list price. His selling system is unique and very powerful.“</em></strong><p>- Jean Garcia</p><p><br/>

<br/><strong><em>“Gupta & Team worked very hard to sell our property. It was not an easy property to handle and we were out of town sellers, making the transaction very time-consuming. They were always pleasant, professional, and knowledgeable. I would highly recommend them to any buyer or seller in a real estate transaction.”</em></strong><p>- Joseph</p><p><br/>

<br/><strong><em>“My wife and I are lucky to have stumbled upon Sharad Gupta. He was very helpful and patient during the entire process, especially for a first-time buyer like us. Thanks a lot, Sharad and Karen for helping us out.”</em></strong><p>- Bharat Singh</p><p><br/>

<br/><strong><em>“It was a great experience working with Sharad. He is not too pushy, explains pros and cons in an unbiased way, and helps make decisions. His knowledge of the areas, estimates for home values, and general understanding of the real estate market is awesome! He not only helps with home buying, but continues to partner and assist with loan process, and follows through the closing in a well laid out methodical way. He also helps with referring handymen or contractors. In my case, he also helped with deciding whether to rent my current home or sell it.after deciding to rent it, he suggested changes and fixes to my home and gave tips to make it attractive to tenants. On a whole, he goes beyond being just a buyer agent and helps with the whole transition.”</em></strong><p>- Prashanth Konkimalla</p><p><br/>

<br/><strong><em>“Was with another realtor for months without selling my house, switched to using Gupta & Team and I was under contract in two and a half weeks! The local knowledge, ability to present my home’s features and network with other realtors I believe was the key."</em></strong><p>-- Tyler Smith</p><p><br/>

<br/><strong><em>“Our house sold at asking price in 9 days. Seamless without any issue. It couldn't get better.”</em></strong><p>-- Elizabeth Gomori</p><p><br/>

<br/><strong><em>It was a pleasure working with Gupta & Team. Thanks to them I saved $5793 in Loan Fees. Closed on my new home in 18 days. Thanks to the Lenders they work with. It was their aggressive home buying system, which got us into our home, despite multiple offers and competition.” - Nimfa Saladino
“Gupta & Team sold my home quickly and for top dollar. You always hear selling a home is stressful but they made it easy and hassle-free. I would highly recommend them.“</em></strong><p>-- Abhishek Mane</p><p>
