<center>Remember these five facts before assuming you can&rsquo;t afford to buy a home.</center>

&nbsp;

It’s a dream we all have: To own our own home and stop paying rent.&nbsp;

To achieve this dream, there are a few issues you need to be aware of as a renter. Why on earth would you continue to lose thousands of dollars by throwing it away on rent, though, when you can take a few minutes to discuss your needs with a real estate agent so you can stop paying rent and start owning? **This conversation costs you nothing**, and you won’t be pressured to buy if you don’t want to. If you take the time to explore your options and learn about the ways you can afford to buy, think of how prepared and relaxed you’ll be when you need to take the necessary steps to buy.

The problem most renters face isn’t the ability to make a monthly mortgage payment. Goodness knows that you must meet this monthly obligation, but the main obstacle for renters is accumulating enough capital to make a down payment. Saving for this lump sum isn’t as difficult as you think, though. Consider these five little-known facts that can help you buy your first home:

**1\. You can buy with much less down than you think.** There are several government programs, such as the first-time homebuyer programs, to help people get into the home of their choice. You can qualify as a first-time buyer even if your spouse has owned a home before as long as your name wasn’t registered on the title. Make sure your real estate agent is well-informed in this very important area so they can suggest programs to open up your options.&nbsp;

**2\. You may be able to get your lender to help with your down payment and closing costs.** Even if you don’t have enough cash for a down payment, aren't debtfree, and don't own an asset free and clear (such as a car), your lending institution may be able to lend you the down payment for your home by securing it against this asset.&nbsp;

**3\. You may be able to create a cash down payment without going into debt.** By borrowing money from certain investments to a specific level, you may be able to generate a significant tax refund you can then use as a down payment. While the money borrowed from these investments is technically considered a loan, the monthly payment can be very small. Moreover, the money invested in the home will still be yours in the end.&nbsp;

**4\. You can buy a home even if you have problems with your credit rating.** If you can come up with more than the minimum down payment or secure the loan with other equity, many lending institutions will consider you for a good mortgage.&nbsp;

**5\. You can (and should) get pre-approved for a loan before looking for a home.** Getting pre-approved is easy, and it can give you complete peace of mind when home shopping. Mortgage experts can obtain a written pre-approval for you at no cost and with no obligation over the phone. A written pre-approval is as good as money in the bank, but consider dealing with a professional who specializes in mortgages. Listing their services can mean the difference between obtaining a mortgage and being stuck in renter’s rut.&nbsp;
