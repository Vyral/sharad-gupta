<p style="text-align: center;"><em>I’m passionate about helping the elderly through Bay Area Older Adults.</em></p>

I was born and raised in India, where ancient traditions seamlessly mingle with modern-day city life. **A core value in Indian culture is the respect we afford to our seniors who are responsible for inculcating the ancient traditions and sharing their wisdom with our youth.**

Living as joint families, caregiving is part and parcel of our culture. According to our religious beliefs, a child who cares for their grandparents is blessed and considered a punya, or the accumulation of good karma.

I’m blessed with a wonderful life here in California and I’m well aware of the sacrifices my parents and grandparents made to make this life a reality. My memories are vivid of my grandfather carrying me with him and helping me to learn how to ride my first bicycle or with my childhood science projects.

**While the passage of time has taken my grandparents away from me, I pay it forward by supporting Bay Area Older Adults.** In the Bay Area, many seniors live alone, one in three have some form of vision loss, and more than 40% of elders age 65 to 84 are widowed. These physical challenges and emotional distress lead to social isolation and detrimental health effects.&nbsp;

Social support is one of the most important contributors to a higher quality of life, health, and wellness for seniors. This is why Bay Area Older Adults focuses on improving their social well-being.&nbsp;

This year, we are on a mission to raise $50,000 for Bay Area Older Adults. **A portion of our fees from every sale goes toward the cause.** You can help us achieve these goals by providing us referrals for your family, friends, or neighbors who may be interested in buying, selling, or investing in real estate. We need your help because referrals are the lifeblood of our business.&nbsp;

Only with your help can we keep building the business and consistently provide the level of service that ensures our clients are always completely satisfied. **We sincerely hope you will tell your friends, family, neighbors, and coworkers about our worthy cause the next time they’re considering a move.** Not only will they get the award-winning service that we are known for, but also a solid portion of our income will go toward a very worthy cause. I invite you to [visit our website](https://www.bayareahothomedeals.com/referrals_help_older_adults?src=referralshelpelders.com){: target="_blank"}, where you can check out the great work they are doing in our community.

If you have any other real estate questions for me, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you.
